Simple graphical user interface for pk2cmd on Linux, Mac and Windows.

![](/doc/pk2cmd-gui.png)

### Features
- Auto-detection of the PIC on your board.
- Can write, run, stop, erase and test a .hex on your board.
- Check the firmware of PicKit 2 and file versions
- Remembers where you chose the .hex even after closing the software :)

### Known bugs/restrictions
- No HEX editor. I don't have any use for it at school so I haven't done it.
- Not possible to transfer running .hex on hard disk.
- You need to install USB driver (see installation notes)
- Some freezes can be seen during process. Don't panic, the PicKit is working and you'll see the output in the logs.
